# August 28th: Making the solar panel placement!
I was very intrigued by the honeycomb shapes, so I decided to make 6 panels all hexagonal that would make a spheric-like shape. I started to CAD it in Solidworks, but the software can be frustrating at times. My parts kept getting error messages when I design them, and I found out that it was due to one single dimension that has made everything so gut-wrenchingly hard. In the end, I was able to make a good enough hexagonal shape that would look good for my design. I also gathered ideas on how to connect the panels together, making the sphere I was talking about earlier; though that is for another day

# August 30th: Making assembling all the panels to make a sphere-like dome.
I started with placing one panel in the center, and making standoffs and connectors that would hold and connect the circuling panels to the center. To do that, I'll just use a strong high infill print of a connector and a long metal sheet or wood to connect the connector to the very end of the circling piece of panel. This took me a while to assemble everything neatly and tidily in an assembly in Solidworks, but it did result in a very cool assembly. The holes match up perfectly so I wont have to drill anything when I actually make the physical project. Though I did face some erorr issues with the assembly too. When I closedt the assembly then reopened it, there would be an mating error, which was really frustrating, but all I had to do was redo some dimensions and it went smooth and sailing again.

# August 31st: Handle attachment for the finished assembly of the panel dome!
With the cool looking panel set-up finished, I started to make an attatchment that would let the whole thing move up and down (y axis) since I want the whole thing to have two moving axes (base 360 degree and panel up and down). The attachment consisted of 4 1x1 aluminium tubes that would be attached in the corners of the center hex panel with connecting 1x1 tubes between each leg. The part looked structurally sound and would look like it would be able to support the weight of the panels. Each panel is around 12 inches in diameter. I did have some issues with where I could put my holes in since it there were so many holes alreayd to connect everything together, but the corners was the best option since no holes occupied there. I then started ot make each individual part then assembling it on the original assembly I had for the panels. I added two hex hubs and bearings that would have a hex shaft going through it for a structurally sound turn. This initiative overall took me a long time to conceive, but it looks very solid and cool! The hex hubs were tweaking out and making my whole assembly have errors so I removed it.
