# August 28th: Making the solar panel placement!
I was very intrigued by the honeycomb shapes, so I decided to make 6 panels all hexagonal that would make a spheric-like shape. I started to CAD it in Solidworks, but the software can be frustrating at times. My parts kept getting error messages when I design them, and I found out that it was due to one single dimension that has made everything so gut-wrenchingly hard. In the end, I was able to make a good enough hexagonal shape that would look good for my design. I also gathered ideas on how to connect the panels together, making the sphere I was talking about earlier; though that is for another day.
